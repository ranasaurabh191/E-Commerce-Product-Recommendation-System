E-Commerce Product Recommendation System
📌 Overview
This project is an E-Commerce Product Recommendation System that suggests products to users based on their past interactions. It leverages various recommendation techniques, including:

Popularity-Based Recommendations
User-Based Collaborative Filtering
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
Matrix Factorization (SVD)
The system is built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask, and SQL and is optimized for high accuracy and efficiency.

🚀 Features
Recommends products to users based on previous ratings and interactions.
Multiple recommendation strategies implemented and compared.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Deployed using Flask API for real-world usability.
🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise
Database: SQL (for storing user-product interactions)
          
📊 Model Evaluation
The project implements multiple recommendation techniques and evaluates them using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

Model Type	RMSE Score
Popularity-Based	XX.XX
User-Based Collaborative Filter	XX.XX
Item-Based Collaborative Filter	XX.XX
SVD (Optimized)	XX.XX
Replace XX.XX with actual RMSE scores after evaluation.

⚡ How to Run
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed (3.8+ recommended). Then, install dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
2️⃣ Load & Preprocess Data
Place your dataset in the data/ directory and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/preprocess.py
3️⃣ Train Recommendation Models
Run the training script to train models:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_models.py
4️⃣ Run Flask API (Deployment)
Start the recommendation API:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Now, visit http://localhost:5000/recommend?user_id=123 to get recommendations!

🔥 Future Enhancements
Deploy as a web app using React.js.
